# Integrating GraphQL in existing PHP project

That's [slides](https://gitpitch.com/caseycs/amsterdam-php-opening-graphql) for a short ~20 minutes opening talk I gave on [Amsterdam PHP meetup](https://www.meetup.com/AmsterdamPHP/events/245071460/) in February 2018.

Done via [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com).
